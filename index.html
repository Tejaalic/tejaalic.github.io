                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I'm Alicia Tejada, a passionate artist and proud mother. My journey as an artist has been an incredible adventure, filled with colors, creativity, and a deep love for self-expression. As a mother, I have also experienced the joys and challenges of nurturing and guiding little hearts.</p>
                        <p>My artistic journey began years ago when I discovered my passion for painting. I specialize in creating stunning portraits that capture the essence and beauty of my subjects. With each stroke of the brush, I strive to convey emotions, stories, and the unique qualities that make each individual special. </p>
                        <p>In addition to canvas paintings, I have also ventured into the world of textile art. I find immense joy in transforming fabrics into vibrant and textured masterpieces. Through my textile creations, I blend colors, patterns, and textures to create unique pieces that reflect my artistic vision.</p>
                        <p>As a mother, I draw inspiration from the love and wonder of watching my children grow. They have taught me to see the world through fresh eyes, encouraging me to explore new techniques, experiment with different mediums, and push the boundaries of my creativity. On this website, you will find a showcase of my artwork, including my captivating portraits and intricate textile pieces.  I hope you find inspiration, joy, and a sense of connection through my artwork and resources. Feel free to reach out, connect, and explore the possibilities together.
                        Wishing you endless inspiration and a colorful journey ahead!</p></div>
